This course presents a gentle introduction into the concepts of data analysis, the role of a Data Analyst, and the tools that are used to perform daily functions. You will gain an understanding of the data ecosystem and the fundamentals of data analysis, such as data gathering or data mining.You will familiarize yourself with the data ecosystem, alongside Databases, Data Warehouses, Data Marts, Data Lakes and Data Pipelines. Continue this exciting journey and discover Big Data platforms such as Hadoop, Hive, and Spark.  

- [x] [__Excel Basics for Data Analysis__](https://github.com/ojal29/IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/Certificates/Excel%20Basics%20for%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)

This course is designed to provide you with basic working knowledge for using Excel spreadsheets for Data Analysis. It covers some of the first steps for working with spreadsheets and their usage in the process of analyzing data.Throughout this course, you'll gain valuable experience working with data sets and spreadsheets. We'll start by introducing you to spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, and show you how to load data from multiple formats. From there, you'll learn how to perform basic data wrangling and cleansing tasks using functions, and expand your knowledge of data analysis through the use of filtering, sorting, and pivot tables. 

- [X] [__Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos__ ](https://github.com/ojal29/IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/Certificates/Data%20Visualization%20and%20Dashboards%20with%20Excel%20and%20Cognos.pdf)

This course covers some of the first steps for telling a compelling story with your data.You'll learn the basics of visualizing data with Excel and IBM Cognos Analytics without having to write any code. You'll start by creating simple charts in Excel such as line, pie and bar charts. You will then create more advanced visualizations with Treemaps, Scatter Charts, Histograms, Filled Map Charts, and Sparklines. Next youâ€™ll also work with the Excel PivotChart feature as well as assemble several visualizations in an Excel dashboard.  This course also teaches you how to use business intelligence (BI) tools like Cognos Analytics  to create interactive dashboards

- [x] [__Python for Data Science, AI & Development__](https://github.com/ojal29/IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/Certificates/Python%20for%20Data%20Science%2CAI%20%26%20Development.pdf)

This introduction to Python course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hoursâ€”no prior programming experience necessary! You will learn about Python basics and the different data types. You will familiarize yourself with Python Data structures like List and Tuples, as well as logic concepts like conditions and branching. You will use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy & Beautiful Soup. Youâ€™ll also use Python to perform tasks such as data collection and web scraping with APIs.
